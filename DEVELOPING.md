# Developing LobbyGuard

## Commit hook

`lefthook.yml` runs gitleaks on staged files before each commit. Install [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev) and
[gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks), then run `lefthook install` once.

## Debugging

In the profile you test in, set `debug_enabled = true` in `doorstop_config.ini`, and `debug_suspend = true` if the game
should wait for the debugger at start-up. Start the game, then run Attach to Lethal Company in VS Code (Mono Debug
extension) or Rider (Mono Remote on 127.0.0.1:10000). Debug builds include symbols, so breakpoints work.

## Tests

Code that doesn't touch Unity can be tested outside the game. Put an xUnit v3 project under `tests/`, for example
`tests/LobbyGuard.Tests/LobbyGuard.Tests.csproj`:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="../../src/LobbyGuard/LobbyGuard.csproj" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.v3" Version="4.0.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Add it to `LobbyGuard.slnx` and run `dotnet test`. CI runs it after the build. The plugin's classes derive from Unity
types, so tests reach the code through other classes, with `InternalsVisibleTo` on the plugin project for internal ones.

## Publishing

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes from CI with the `TCLI_AUTH_TOKEN` organization secret, once the build passes. To
publish from your own computer, create a service account token for the team on Thunderstore (Settings, Teams, Service
Accounts) and store it once:

- Linux: `secret-tool store --label "Thunderstore LethalCompanyModding" service thunderstore username LethalCompanyModding`,
  then paste the token.
- Windows: `Install-Module CredentialManager`, then
  `New-StoredCredential -Persist LocalMachine -Target 'thunderstore:LethalCompanyModding' -Password <token>`.

Then run `dotnet build -c Release -p:PublishTS=true`. Don't add `-bl` or `-v:d` to a publish build: MSBuild logs task
inputs, and the token is one.
